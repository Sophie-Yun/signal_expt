3,2022-01-16,01:08:11,8767,01:19:41,11.49705,undefined,I focused on which potential target my partner was closest to if they didn't go to it. For example, if they were closer to an orange triangle than I was and didn't go to it (which I am making the assumption that they would go to it if it was the target & they were closer to minimize our moves), I would pay attention to this. Continuing this example, if the hint they gave me was "Square," then I would assume that they were directing me to go to the green square because if they wanted me to go to the orange square it would have been more logical to give me the hint "Orange." ,Slightly. I noticed that my partner was not moving towards any targets and there were 4 target options instead of 3 so I had to adjust how I approached the game.,true,1440,704
